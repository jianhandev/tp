## 1. Introduction
(Contributed by Li Jianhan & Shi Hui Ling)

Welcome to Baymax! Are you a healthcare professional looking for a reliable app to keep track of patients and
appointments? You have come to the right place!

Baymax is a Command Line Interface (CLI) focused desktop application that helps you to manage patient appointments using just
the keyboard itself, no fiddling with the mouse needed. The main features include:

1. Managing appointments
2. Managing patient information 
3. Calendar

With Baymax, you can manage appointments efficiently with our integrated Calendar tool. We have put a lot of effort into
designing our User Interface so that it feels as intuitive to first-time users as it can be. You will be amazed by what 
you can achieve with Baymax through a clean and simple User Interface. What are you waiting for? Head on to Section 2, “Quick Start”!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest version of `baymax.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Baymax application.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds.
   This is the dashboard.
   
   ![Ui](images/Dashboard.png)<br>

## 3. About
(Contributed by Li Jianhan, Thuta Htun Wai, Kaitlyn Ng, Reuben & Shi Hui Ling)

### 3.1. Structure of this Document
To give you the most amount of flexibility over what you can do with Baymax, we have provided a large set of features.
We have structured this User Guide in such a way that you can easily find what you need. In the next subsection,
*Section 3.2 Reading this Document*, you will find useful tips on using this document. All of Baymax's features and 
commands are documented in the following section, *Section 5 Features*. You can sift through these features
and commands easily by referring to the Table of Contents at the top of this User Guide, or to 
*Section 7 Summary of Commands*.

### 3.2. Reading this Document
This subsection familiarises you with all the technical terms, symbols and syntax that are used throughout this 
document, in order to make it easier for you to read the rest of the document. 

#### 3.2.1. GUI Terminology

![addpatient](images/gui.png)<br>
*Figure 3.2.1a. GUI Components*

GUI Component | Description
--------------|--------------
Command Box   | Commands are entered here.
Command Result Box | Success and error messages of command executions are displayed here.
Tabs | Dashboard, Calendar, Schedule, Patient, Appointment, and Additional Information tabs can be accessed here. Note that the tabs are **not** clickable. See [here](#4-navigating-between-tabs) to find out how to navigate between tabs.
Main Display | Calendar views, Patient lists and Appointment lists are displayed here in their respective tabs.

#### 3.2.2. General Symbols

The table below explains the general symbols and syntax used throughout the document.

Symbol/Syntax    |  What does it mean?
---------------- | -------------------
<ins>underlined</ins> | Information that you need to pay special attention to, especially for the parameters.
`command`           | A grey highlight (called a code-block markup) indicates that this is a command that can be typed into the command box and executed by the application.
:information_source:        | Special notes/tips regarding that specific command/feature.
:warning:       | Notes prompting you to confirm that the command you are going to enter is really intended.

#### 3.2.3. Command Format & Syntax

You enter specific commands into the *Command box* of the GUI to use Baymax's features and perform tasks.

Most of the commands take the following format: 

`command_word prefix/PARAMETER`, e.g. `addpatient name/Alex Yeoh nric/S1234567A phone/98765432 gender/M`
* **Command_word:** word that specifies the task being performed, e.g. `addpatient`
* **Prefix:** word that specifies the parameter type being supplied, e.g. `name`, `nric`
* **PARAMETER:** information and details about various patients and appointments specified by you, e.g Alex Yeoh

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be **supplied** by you.

  E.g. `addpatient name/NAME`: can be used as `addpatient name/Alice Tan...`

* When the command requires time in HH:MM format, it follows the **24 Hour** System. 
 
  E.g. 01:00 means 1 a.m. and 13:00 means 1 p.m.

* Items in square brackets are **optional**.

  E.g. `name/NAME [r/REMARK]`: can be used as `name/Alice Tan r/No drug allergy` or as `name/Alice Tan`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used **multiple** times including zero times.<br>
  
  E.g. `[tag/TAG]…​`: can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `tag/braces`, `tag/braces tag/cleaning` etc.

* Parameters can be supplied in **any order**.

  E.g. `name/NAME phone/PHONE_NUMBER`: can also be used as `phone/PHONE_NUMBER name/NAME`.
  
* Compulsory parameters supplied more than once will be deemed **invalid**.
    
  E.g. Entering `addpatient name/John name/Jane nric/S1234567G phone/12345678 gender/F` where `name` is a compulsory field will give:
   
  ![invalidparams](images/multipleparamsnotaccepted.png)<br>

**Format:**<br>
`listapptsof INDEX`<br>
`listapptsof nric/NRIC`<br>
`listapptsof name/NAME`<br>

Parameter Name | Description

INDEX     | The index of the patient in the most recently displayed list. It must be a <ins>positive</ins> integer.
NRIC           | The NRIC of the patient.
NAME           | The name by which to search for the patient. It must be the exact full name of the patient.

* `editappt INDEX on/DATETIME`

## 6. FAQ
(Contributed by Hui Ling)

**Q:** Do I have to manually save any data? 

**A:** No. Baymax saves your data to the hard disk automatically after any command that changes data. 

**Q:** How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A:** Baymax automatically saves all your data in a folder named `data` in the same directory as the application.
 You can copy and transfer the `data` folder into the same directory as Baymax on your other computer and Baymax 
 will automatically load your data upon launching Baymax.

**Q:** What do I do if I marked an appointment as `done`/`missed` wrongly?

**A:** Unfortunately, the current version of Baymax does not have the `undo` features yet to help you change it back to `upcoming`. You will need to delete that appointment and add it back again.
However, if you wish to change `done` to `missed` and vice versa, you can use the `missed` command and `done` command respectively.
